## Navisworks tested versions

* Navisworks Manage 2019
* Navisworks Manage 2018

## Dependencies
Dependencies are loaded by configuration - 2019 uses NW 2019 dlls and net 4.7 as framework, 2018 uses NW 2018 and net 4.6. 
TUM dll need to be build in submodule to use it as reference.

## Installation
Build the project and the Build events will copy the dlls to the right folder or copy them yourself to (replace 2019 with the version of Navisworks you have):

``` %APPDATA%\Autodesk Navisworks Manage 2019\Plugins\  ```

TUM.VPLcontrol should be compiled using ENG version which includes different features than original version.
